# Smash-Brawl
RPG Game

This game has been created for a Bootcamp project.

In this game, like the real Super SmashBros Brawl for Nintendo, the user should choose a character, taking in a consideration the abilities of it.

After choosing a character, the User should choose the opponent he wants his character to fight against. He can choose all the other characters available but the fighter he already chose. 

To Begin the fight, the User needs to click the "Attack" button on the Battle field, this attack button should be pressed until the defender has been defeated (if it hasn't been defeated before)...

If the fighter selected gets defeated before the battle ends... the game is OVER! and the User should restart by clicking the "restart" button on the battle field, the game to start a new Battle.

However, if the fighter continues to defeat the defender one by one, the Victory will be yours! 
You can re-play by clickin the reset button.

The project is useful to understand the the bascis of the functions and the events on JavaScript and JQuery. Also, if you have time to go thru my code, you might be surprise of how short your code can get.
